DANGER!! THIS SOFTWARE PROJECT IS JUST BEGINNING - EVERYTHING IS UNSTABLE AND CRUDDY!

Eventually, this project will develop into a plugin- and theme-based blogging / CMS platform for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) to rival WordPress for PHP.

Make sure you have NodeJS installed then run the following commands in the project's root directory:

    npm install
    npm start

This will start the server and display the URL to the website root and to the admin interface (where you can created and edit pages).
